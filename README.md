## Aim: 
To Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

## **Algorithm:**

1. Start the application.
2. Identify the objective – organizing daily tasks.
3. Create a **basic prompt** to generate a simple list of tasks.
4. Refine the prompt to include **categories (work, personal, urgent, optional)**.
5. Further enhance the prompt to include **deadlines, priorities, and time allocations**.
6. Add advanced features like **motivational quotes, reminders, or tips**.
7. Compare outputs at each stage to observe how prompt design impacts results.
8. Finalize the structured daily task organizer prompt.
9. End.
